<!-- At the SODA Nexus (SOftware Debugging and Analysis Nexus), we develop innovative tools and solutions to improve modern software development. Our research supports software engineering teams in two key ways:

Decision Support in DevOps
By mining and analyzing software repositories, we uncover patterns from past development practices to guide better decisions today.

Automated Debugging and Testing
We extract and analyze data from software build systems and pipelines to assist release engineering teams in achieving reliable, efficient, and high-quality releases.
